## Megan Hessel 👋

## 🔭 I’m currently working on... 
I am current working on getting my masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at University of California, Santa Barbara. 
Take a look at my [professional website] (https://meganhessel.github.io/about.html) and dive into this Github repository for updates and various projects I have completed! 


## 📕 Education 
I graduated from the University of Tampa with a B.S. in Environmental Studies and minors in Marine Science and Sustainability. I went on to earn a Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) from UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, where I developed expertise in statistical modeling, programming, and data visualization.

## 🌱 Experience
My experience is a mix of labatory work, data analytics, qualitative research, and public outreach! 

During undergrad, I participated in multiple research projects. I was the lab manager of the Spatial Ecology Lab (SEL), where I conducted research on the diets, spatial distribution, and age and growth patterns of both native and invasive fish species though stomach dissections, external floy tagging, and otolith examination. Partnering with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, I used fishing tournament records to analyze and map the significant changes in King Mackerel populations spatially and over time. Within SEL, I also developed the annual Invasive and Cichlid Kids (ICK) Fishing Tournament where we taught children about the local marine ecology, safe fishing techniques, and becoming environmental stewards. Furthermore, I was an active member in a public health vaping project, called Vaping On Campus (VOC), where I administered surveys, interviews, and focus groups to study college students’ perceptions of vaping to create effective and targeted vaping cessation programs.

I also have interned for Sarasota County Government in the Parks and Recreational department. In this position, I designed environmental education programs that raised awareness and helped communities reconnect with the natural world. This included children marine science camps, fishing expeditions, beach clean-ups, invasive plant removal, native tree planting, and seagrass and Florida Scrub Jay surveys.
